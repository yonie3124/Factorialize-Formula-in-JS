//Declare a function factorialize(n) that takes an integer n as input and returns the factorial of the provided integer.

// first need to declare whe initial variable and its value to 1. 
// then declare a loop that starts from 1 and less than or equal to the number need to calculate the factorial, then increment the initial value by one for every step
// then multiply the first multi variable with every i
// then console.log()


let multi = 1;
for(i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
  multi = multi * i;

}
  console.log(multi);
